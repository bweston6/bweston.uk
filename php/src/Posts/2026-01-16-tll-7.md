The first Linked List of 2026! The links haven't let up either so there's lots of interesting tidbits to look through.

BOIOIOING!

Fix Your robots.txt or Your Site Disappears from Google
: <https://www.alanwsmith.com/en/37/wa/jz/s1/>
: TL;DR: if a site doesn't have a `robots.txt` it will no longer be indexed by Google.

Free Software Scares Normal People

Junior
: <https://www.junior.cards/>
: This is a card and game company from Louie Mantia. The cards and dice look great but the real treasure is in the [games section](https://www.junior.cards/games/) that has great instructions for games to play with family and friends.

Uh Oh! The Infantilization of Failure
: <https://www.joanwestenberg.com/uh-oh-the-infantilization-of-failure/>
: The title phrase of this article has been going around in my head for months now. Its something we see everywhere, especially from larger companies, and it gets on my nerves.

What's in my HomeLab: 2026
: <https://romanzipp.com/blog/whats-in-my-homelab-2026>
: Loads of useful services in here. I'm definitely going to try out [Owntracks](https://github.com/owntracks/owntracks) so I can keep track of where I was without giving my location to Google.

My Postcode Lookup Library now Supports Partial Postcodes
: <https://computingthedetails.org/blog/my-postcode-lookup-library-now-supports-partial-postcodes/>
: Also on YouTube: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkT7JeEV8X0> 
: I'd definitely read/watch the first part if you haven't already. Although it's nice to get location from a postcode locally, I still think that most sites that implement this will just send that location to a 3rd party map API, yet again leaking your location. 

Backing up Spotify
: <https://annas-archive.li/blog/backing-up-spotify.html>
: Anna's blog is now back up after being down for a few weeks after the Spotify archive was released. The data in this is really well presented and I find it crazy how much AI generated music people have submitted to Spotify over the last couple years.
